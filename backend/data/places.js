For example, in the quarry were found balls of diorite stone - each weighing up to 6 kg - that were used as hammers to separate and cut the sides of the obelisk, and their effects are visible on the obelisk body, a process that precedes the work of a trench around the obelisk that allows this huge mass to be fully released.",
